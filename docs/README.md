# DLC Unlocker

## ⚠️Warning⚠️

Attention, **SOME** weapons and weapon modifications are allowed, but most of them gives cheater tag. If you want to enter a public lobby, make sure you avoid using weapons, weapon modifications, masks and weapons colors that are DLC because otherwise, you will automatically be kicked by public lobbies.

## What gives you cheater tag
 - Masks from DLC
 - Weapons from DLC
 - Some Weapons Modifications from DLC
 - Hosting an contract heist from DLC
 - Weapons Colours from DLC
 - Patterns and Materials Mask from DLC
 - Melee item from DLC

## What doesn't give you cheater tag

 - Perck Decks from DLC
 - Equipment from DLC such as molotov, kingpin injector etc.
 - **SOME** Weapons modifications from DLC

 I recommend doing separate builds, a host build, and a client build without getting cheater tag.

 For example, without dlc unlocker I couldn't do some modifications to my shotgun. But with dlc unlocker, i can do modifications without having cheater tag and here is an example of modifications that are allowed and doesn't give cheater tag!
