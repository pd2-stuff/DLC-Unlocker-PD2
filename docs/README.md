## ⚠️Warning⚠️

⚠️If you want to unlock all DLCs, only drag the unlock_all_dlcs folder into the mods folder  
⚠️If you only want to unlock Characters, only drag the unlock_only_characters folder into the mods folder  
⚠️If you only want to unlock Heists, only drag the unlock_only_heists folder into the mods folder

**ALWAYS** do separate builds!!!  

Attention, **SOME** weapons and weapon modifications are allowed, but most of them give you CHEATER TAG. If you want to enter a public lobby, make sure you avoid using weapons, weapon modifications, masks and weapons colors that are DLC - otherwise, you will be automatically kicked from the game.

If you dont want to get cheater tag, get the safe version of dlc unlocker here

## Installation
You need SuperBLT for the mod to work. [Download it here.](https://superblt.znix.xyz)  
Download the DLC Unlocker [here!](https://codeload.github.com/pd2-stuff/DLC-Unlocker-PD2/zip/refs/heads/master)  

To find the game folder you can do the following:

If you're on Steam:

![steam_browse_local_files](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pd2-stuff/DLC-Unlocker-PD2/master/docs/img/steam_local_files.gif)

If you're on Epic Games: (Ignore the fact the example shows GTA, you can do the same for Payday 2)

![epic_browse_local_files](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pd2-stuff/DLC-Unlocker-PD2/master/docs/img/epic_local_files.gif)

Then, just extract the zip into the Payday 2 mods folder!

If you don't have a mods folder yet, launch Payday 2 once after you've installed SuperBLT. Doing this will create the mods folder and install the required SuperBLT Hook and dependencies.

This popup will appear. Press 'Yes' and wait until it's done.

![superblt_popup](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pd2-stuff/DLC-Unlocker-PD2/master/docs/img/superblt_popup.png)

Afterwards, you should see the mods folder and you're ready to install the DLC Unlocker.


Start the game and enjoy!
