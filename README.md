## ⚠️Warning⚠️

⚠️If you only want to unlock Characters, only drag the unlock_only_characters folder into the mods folder  
⚠️If you only want to unlock Gloves and Outfits, only drag the unlock_outfit_gloves folder into the mods folder
You only can choose 1 folder to drop at mods folder

## Installation
You need SuperBLT for the mod to work. [Download it here.](https://superblt.znix.xyz)  
Download the DLC Unlocker [here!](https://codeload.github.com/pd2-stuff/DLC-Unlocker-PD2/zip/refs/heads/master)  

To find the game folder you can do the following:

If you're on Steam:

![steam_browse_local_files](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pd2-stuff/DLC-Unlocker-PD2/master/docs/img/steam_local_files.gif)

If you're on Epic Games: (Ignore the fact the example shows GTA, you can do the same for Payday 2)

![epic_browse_local_files](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pd2-stuff/DLC-Unlocker-PD2/master/docs/img/epic_local_files.gif)

Then, just extract the zip into the Payday 2 mods folder!

If you don't have a mods folder yet, launch Payday 2 once after you've installed SuperBLT. Doing this will create the mods folder and install the required SuperBLT Hook and dependencies.

This popup will appear. Press 'Yes' and wait until it's done.

Afterwards, you should see the mods folder and you're ready to install the DLC Unlocker.


Start the game and enjoy!
